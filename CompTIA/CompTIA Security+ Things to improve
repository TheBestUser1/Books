Chapter 11:

L2TP uses IPSEC for encryption. Others don't
Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption (MPPE) is used with PPTP to provide encryption.


Smurf Attack - Spoof IP and send ping to broadcast
Ping-of-death - Very large ICMP packets that can't be processed
LDAP Injection 


TCP Wrappers are a feature on a Linux-based host that allows control of access to different services. 

There can't be quantitative analysis without ALE, SLE and ARO. If it has dollar figures, without that, it's Business Impact Analysis.

Incremental / differential Back-ups

Audit logs contain failed logon attempts


How DNS zone transfers work

EFS - requires NTFS and can encrypt individual files. 

TPM - Trusted Platform Module is a computer chip on a system that stores the cryptographic keys that are used to encrypt data. Applications that use passwords to encrypt data are susceptible to dictionary attacks, while TPM has a dictionary attack prevention module built in. In Windows 7/2008, BitLocker supports using TPM to store the key. Keep in mind that to use it, you must have a TPM-supported BIOS

HSM - The Hardware Security Module is a card that is added to a system that contains a crypto-processor to perform asymmetric cryptographic functions at the hardware level. It also contains chips that store the crypto-keys to be used by the system.


Policies are not part and are not developed with the Business Contiuity Plan. Policies are created waaaaaay before. 

ICMP is a protocol along the lines of TCP and UDP. Therefore it does not rely on them for transport, it does not use port numbers and is not limited to Layer 3.
